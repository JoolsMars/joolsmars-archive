> a quiet corner in the void — just some notes, scraps, and experiments. nothing serious.

### 👾 About
This repo doesn’t really have a single purpose. It’s more like a sandbox:
- Random code snippets
- Half-baked experiments
- Archive of things I don’t want to lose

Don’t expect consistency here — this is mostly for me, but you’re free to look around.

---

### 🪐 Contents
- `/snippets` — small code fragments, tests, or demos
- `/notes` — markdown dumps, logs, rough ideas
- `/misc` — everything else that doesn’t fit

---

### 🚀 Status
Just a ghost repo. No roadmap. No guarantees.  
Think of it like an abandoned outpost floating in orbit.

---

### 📜 License
Unlicensed. Do whatever you want.
